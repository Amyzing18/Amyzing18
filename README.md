My name is Amy and I'm currently working on finising the final units of pre-work before classes start for Tech Elevator. I'm very new to coding and learning so much every day. 
A fun fact about me is that I used to play roller derby. I enjoy talking about the sport of roller derby, so you can ask me about it any time.
